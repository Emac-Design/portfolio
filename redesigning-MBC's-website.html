            <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>The website was initially re-designed and re-built from scratch and published back in February 2018.</p>

                <p>Whilst this design was a drastic improvement to the preious design - it wasn't designed and built on user needs.</p>

                <p>Some user needs were used to influence the design and build but the main drive was to give a new lease of life by using <a href="https://www.gov.uk" target="_blank">GOV.UK</a> as it's foundation.</p>

                <p>The sites accessibility was greatly improved but it still fell short of where it needed to be. The new WCAG 2.1 guidelines came in Sepetmber 2019.</p>

                <p>The decision was made to re-design the website once more to fix the accessibility issues to comply to WCAG 2.1 and to make sure it meets user needs.</p>

                <p>The first iteration was designed and developed by a previous member of them team. You can view that design <a href="https://www.maidstone.gov.uk/test/test-designs/new-homepage-design/home#">here</a>. Some of the user needs haven't been met as we didn't conduct any user research with Councillors or staff.</p>

                <p>This lead to multiple iterations of this design.</p>

            <h2>User research and user needs</h2>

              <p>There were several types of users defined in this project. They included the residents of the borough, residents outside of the borough as well as internal users such as staff and Councillors</p>

              <p>Some of the user needs are listed below.</p>

                <h3>External user needs</h3>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a user using a mobile, I want a link back to the top of the page, so that I don't have to scroll back to the top.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a user, I want to find common tasks, so that I don't have search through the site to find them.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a user, I want won't use an A to Z, as the terms I use won't match the terms the Council uses.</p>			
                    </blockquote>

                <h3>Internal user needs</h3>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a Councillor, I want the site to have a clear brand with our logo, so users are clear what site their on.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a Councillor, I need our website to be visually appealing, so that I'm happy to refer to it.</p>			
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a member of staff, I need the website to be easy to navigate, so that I can tell someone on the phone how to find something.</p>
                    </blockquote> 
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>As a member the Digital Services team, I need the website to be accessible, so that we're compliant with WCAG 2.1.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>After conducting user research with our Counicllors, they thought that the search bar on the first design was too prominent as they didn't use it or found that it didn't work the way they expected it to.</p>

                <p>They also thought the design wasn't visually appealing. They commented that other local authority sites were more appealing making them want to engage more with the site. The thing these sites had in common was icons.</p>


            <h2>Design and interations</h2>

              <p>Further adaptations of the design were created through Adobe XD using a 12 column grid as the final design will be developed using Bootstrap.</p>

              <h3>Top tasks</h3>

              <p>User research showed that they was demand for a top tasks section. This is an area where a user can easily find transactions they're most likely to use without having to navigation through to sections of the site.</p>

              <p>The research made it clear that this section needed to sit above our main services area.</p>

              <img>

              <h3>Visual appearance</h3>

                <h4>Search bar</h4>

                <img>

                <p>User research showed that there were issues with the search. I drastically decreased its size and placed it in the top right hand corner of the navigation bar.</p>


                <h4>Icons</h4>

                  <img>

                  <p>Initital designs incorporated icons into the top tasks as stated above. User research will be needed to </p>

                <h4>Service area listing</h4>

                  <p>This area has had serveral iterations. Feedback from the coded design said that users weren't clear that each service area had more than three subsections within it.</p>

                  <p>Several options we're explored to overcome this issue. One included removing all options whilst purely having the heading as a link with an icon to the left of it. The most recent iteration will combine the two as users felt in the dark as to what the service area heading offered.</p>

                    <img>

              <h3>A to Z</h3>

                <p>One of the user needs for the re-design made it clear that the A to Z wasn't used.</p>

                <p>It takes up a lot of space on our current design so I've shrunk this down completely by removing the alphabet listing and creating small section above the footer that contains a to the A to Z page.</p>

              <h3>Micro interactions</h3>

                <h4>Links</h4>

                  <p>Our current design doesn't always underline links - especially on our alerts so a user doesn't always know that they can interact with that element.</p>
                  <p>This has fixed by underlining all links across the site.</p>

                <h4>Hover states</h4>

                  <p>On the current design the hover state on link change from our corporate blue to a pink. The shade of pink fails colour contrast ratios for WCAG 2.1 so this needed to be updated.</p>

                  <p>The hover state on the new design will change to a darker shade of our corporate blue.</p>

                <h4>Focus states</h4>

                  <p>On the current design there are no focus states on an interactable element.</p>

                  <p>The new design does have focus interactable elements. They're based off GOV.UK approach using a yellow background with black text.</p>

              <h3>CSS</h3>

                <p>This new design is using SASS file rather than a conventional CSS file.</p>

                <p>I wanted to use SASS for a few reasons. Firstly, to keep up with modern development trends but also to improve the sites web performance. Another reason is to improve the skills within our team - everyone will learn a new skill.</p>

                      <h2>The future</h2>
            
                      <p>The latest design is being presented to our wider leadership team at the end of March. I'll update this section afterwards.</p>
